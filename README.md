## Record Request Manager

Record request application.

A full stack MERN application used to complete CRUD operations for a sample user requesting records. built with React for the frontend, Redux for state management, JavaScript, CSS, React Bootstrap for styling. Mongo DB for database storage. 

## Project Status


I'm working on user functionality and authentication. Users should only see their request.

This project is currently in development. Users can filter records request by username and keyword and see visual data representation. The functionality to sort and search by parameters is in progress.
